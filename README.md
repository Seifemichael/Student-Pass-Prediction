# Student Pass Prediction
In this work, a predictive model is developed to predict the pass or failure of a given student based on a subject data that includes attributes like age, sex, absences, motherâ€™s job etc.   I first did an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to come up with correlations and hidden insights from the attributes. Then, the feature engineering is done. Finally, a predictive model is presented. I also used python on Jupyter notebook. 
The main libraries used in this work are:
 - Pandas for data manipulation and ingestion
 - Matplotlib for data visualization
 - Numpy for multidimensional array computing
 - sklearn for machine learning and predictive modeling
The work is presented in the notebook file [Student-Pass-ApexSystems](https://github.com/Seifemichael/Student-Pass-Prediction/blob/master/Student-Pass-ApexSystems.ipynb)
